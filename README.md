# Header

Some text in the new repository created.

To check the status/track of all the files created adn deleted in a repo: 
git status

So track a file we can do: 
git add "File_name"

To ensure git keeps track of all the files in a repo:
git add .   // When you use "." then it keeps track of all the files automatically 
               otherwise you have to mention mofdified File name everytime.






To commit something new:
git commit -m "Title Description" -m "Detailed discription"

To upload the changes on github:
git push origin master

To make upload default we can do:
git push -u origin master 

Note: When you create a repo using GUI the above command changes from master to main:
      git push origin main
